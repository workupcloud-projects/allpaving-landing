# All Paving Design System Update Plan

## Overview
Transform the All Paving website to use a proper design system with consistent colors, reduced gradients, and sharper styling appropriate for a professional construction company.

## Color System
- **Primary**: #009339 (All Paving Green)
- **Highlight/Accent**: #ffcc00 (Construction Yellow)
- **Secondary/Gray**: #3c3c3b (Professional Gray)

## Design Principles
- **Professional & Serious**: Reduce excessive gradients and animations
- **Sharp & Modern**: Less rounded corners for industrial feel
- **Construction Industry**: Colors and styling that convey reliability and expertise

### Phase 2: Component Updates (Systematic approach)
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Update `HeroSection.tsx` - Replace hardcoded colors, reduce gradients, sharper borders
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Update `CompanyOverview.tsx` - Apply new color system, reduce roundness

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

## Implementation Notes
- Use CSS custom properties for colors instead of hardcoded hex values
- Reduce `rounded-3xl`, `rounded-2xl` to `rounded-lg`, `rounded-md` for sharper look
- Minimize gradient usage - use solid colors or subtle gradients only
- Maintain accessibility and readability
- Keep hover effects but make them more subtle and professional

## Success Criteria
- All colors use CSS custom properties
- Professional, construction-industry appropriate design
- Sharper, more angular styling
- Consistent design system across all components
- No hardcoded color values in components
